What

Configuration of an Authority server (used by clients to authorize users) includes: 
    Which client can use it
    How a client interact with it
    What API a client can access (through the access token it publishes to the client)

Currently the DIPS Front Authority server is configured by a config file

My d:hack was to see how to implement a powershell based cli to do the configuration

Advantages (I focus first on development env scenarios)
    Developers do not need to know / have access to configuration file on server
    Do not need to understand config structure: uses well defined commands with help info (powershell is good in this department) to do task like adding a client, 
    see info about client and add api access to clients.
